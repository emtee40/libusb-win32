LibUsb-Win32 USB Benchmark
Console Application

USAGE: benchmark [pid=] [list] [read|write|loop] [notestselect] [vid=]
                 [retry=] [timeout=] [buffersize=] [refresh=] [ep=] [intf=]
Commands:
         list  : Display a list of connected devices before starting. 
                 Select the device to use for the test from the list.
         read  : Read from the device.
         write : Write to the device.
         loop  : [Default] Read and write to the device at the same time.
         notestselect : Skips submitting the control transfers to get/set the
                        test type.  This makes the application compatible
                        with non-benchmark firmwared devices that have
                        loopback endpoint(s).  (forces loop mode)
Switches:
         pid        : Product id of device. (hex)
         vid        : Vendor id of device. (hex) (Default=0x04D8)
         retry      : Number of times to retry a transfer that timesout
         timeout    : Transfer timeout value. (in milliseconds) (Default=1)
                      The timeout value used for read/write operations. If a
                      transfer times out more than {retry} times, the test 
                      fails and the operation is aborted.
         buffersize : Transfer test size in bytes. (Default=4096)
                      Increasing this value will generally yield higher
                      transfer rates. Using a value greater than 65536 is not
                      recommended. 
         priority   : AboveNormal|BelowNormal|Highest|Lowest|Normal
                      (Default=AboveNormal) The thread priority level to use
                      for the test.
         refresh    : The display refresh interval. (in milliseconds)
                      (Default=1000) This also effect the running status.
         ep         : The loopback endpoint to use. For example ep=0x01, would
                      read from 0x81 and write to 0x01.
         intf       : The interface id the loopback endpoint resides in.  
         
WARNING:
          This example only works with custom usb hardware. Using this
          example on a usb device it was not designed for could be
          catastrophic! To meet the requirements, your usb hardware
          must implement loopback functionality in Config 1,
          Interface 0, Endpoints 0x01 and 0x81.
          
Examples:

benchmark vid=1234 pid=5678
benchmark vid=0x4D2 pid=0x162E
benchmark vid=0x4D2 pid=0x162E buffersize=65536
benchmark read vid=0x4D2 pid=0x162E
